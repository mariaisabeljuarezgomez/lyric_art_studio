# Session Management Fix

## Problem
You had hundreds of session files in the `sessions/` folder because multiple server configurations were conflicting:

- `server-railway-production.js` - Uses PostgreSQL sessions (correct)
- `server-enhanced.js` - Uses file-based sessions (causing the problem)
- Other server files with mixed configurations

## Root Cause
The `session-file-store` dependency was creating file-based sessions instead of using PostgreSQL sessions, causing:
1. Hundreds of `.json` files in the `sessions/` folder
2. Session authentication failures
3. Corrupted downloads (HTML login pages instead of files)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Cleaned Up Session Files
- ✅ Deleted all session files from `sessions/` folder
- ✅ Cleared corrupted sessions from PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Removed `session-file-store` dependency from package.json

### 2. Fixed Server Configuration
- ✅ Created `start-server.js` to ensure correct server file is always used
- ✅ Updated package.json scripts to use the startup script
- ✅ Added cleanup script for future maintenance

### 3. Prevention Measures
- ✅ Added `sessions/` to `.gitignore` (already existed)
- ✅ Created `cleanup-sessions.js` script
- ✅ Added `npm run cleanup` command

## How to Use

### Starting the Server
```bash
# Always use this to start the server (uses PostgreSQL sessions)
npm start

# Or directly
node start-server.js
```

### Cleaning Up Sessions (if needed)
```bash
# Remove all session files and clear database sessions
npm run cleanup

# Or directly
node cleanup-sessions.js
```

### What Each Script Does
- `npm start` - Starts server with PostgreSQL sessions
- `npm run cleanup` - Removes file-based sessions and clears database sessions
- `npm run dev` - Same as start (uses PostgreSQL sessions)

## Important Notes

1. **Always use `npm start`** - This ensures PostgreSQL sessions are used
2. **Never run `server-enhanced.js` directly** - It creates file-based sessions
3. **Session files are ignored by git** - They won't be committed
4. **PostgreSQL sessions are persistent** - They survive server restarts

## File Structure
```
├── server-railway-production.js  # Main server (PostgreSQL sessions)
├── start-server.js               # Startup script (ensures correct server)
├── cleanup-sessions.js           # Cleanup script
├── sessions/                     # File-based sessions (ignored by git)
└── package.json                  # Updated scripts
```

## Troubleshooting

If you see session files accumulating again:
1. Run `npm run cleanup`
2. Restart the server with `npm start`
3. Check which server file is running

If downloads are corrupted:
1. Run `npm run cleanup` to clear sessions
2. Restart server with `npm start`
3. Log in again to create fresh session
4. Try downloading again
