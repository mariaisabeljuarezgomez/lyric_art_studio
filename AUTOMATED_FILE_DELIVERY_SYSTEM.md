  - Calls `fileDeliveryService.processOrder()`
  - Sends confirmation email

**3. Order Data Structure**
```javascript
const orderData = {
    orderId: orderId || `order_${Date.now()}`,
    designId: designId,
    designName: designInfo.title || designId,
    customerEmail: 'customer@example.com', // From order
    customerName: 'Customer', // From order
    amount: amount,
    paymentId: paymentId
};
```

**4. PayPal Order Creation Enhancement**
