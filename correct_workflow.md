Your Correct Workflow:
Display Images: All web pages (wishlist, cart, gallery, etc.) show images from images/designs/{folder-name}/{folder-name}.webp - these are optimized webp images for web display
Design IDs: The design ID used throughout the system should be the exact folder name from images/designs/ (which should match the folder name in music_lyricss/)
Downloads: When a user purchases/downloads, the files come from music_lyricss/{same-folder-name}/ containing the original files (SVG, PDF, EPS, PNG)
Wishlist System: Users should be able to add designs to wishlist from the gallery, and those designs should appear in the wishlist section with the correct images from images/designs/
